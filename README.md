Codewars challenges are about 'learning, training and improving your coding skills by solving programming tasks of many types and difficulty levels.'

## Goal
Solving coding challenges every day to stay sharp.

## But why?
Because I see my coding life as a never-ending learning process. By doing all those challenges one often gets to see a different perspective on things. Some solutions are simple yet elegant, some are focusing more on efficiency or readability. 

But above all, solving puzzles are fun!
