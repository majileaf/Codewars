Your retro heavy metal band, VÄxën, originally started as kind of a joke, just because why would anyone want to 
use the crappy foosball table in your startup's game room when they could be rocking out at top volume in there 
instead? Yes, a joke, but now all the top tech companies are paying you top dollar to play at their conferences 
and big product-release events. And just as how in the early days of the Internet companies were naming everything

Well, with great power chords there must also come great responsibility! You need to help these companies out by 
writing a function that will guarantee that their web sites and ads and everything else will 
RÖCK ÄS MÜCH ÄS PÖSSÏBLË! Just think about it -- with the licensing fees you'll be getting from Gööglë, Fäcëböök, 
Äpplë, and Ämäzön alone, you'll probably be able to end world hunger, make college and Marshall stacks free to all, 
and invent self-driving bumper cars. Sö lët's gët röckïng and röllïng! Pëdal tö thë MËTÄL!

Here's a little cheatsheet that will help you write your function to replace the so-last-year letters 
a-e-i-o-u-and-sometimes-y with the following totally rocking letters:

A = Ä = \u00c4     E = Ë = \u00cb     I = Ï = \u00cf
O = Ö = \u00d6     U = Ü = \u00dc     Y = Ÿ = \u0178
a = ä = \u00e4     e = ë = \u00eb     i = ï = \u00ef
o = ö = \u00f6     u = ü = \u00fc     y = ÿ = \u00ff
