/* Grandma learning to text
Write a function that replaces 'two', 'too' and 'to' with the number '2'. 
Even if the sound is found mid word (like in octopus) or not in lowercase grandma 
still thinks that should be replaced with a 2. Bless her.

'I love to text' becomes 'I love 2 text'
'see you tomorrow' becomes 'see you 2morrow'
'look at that octopus' becomes 'look at that oc2pus'

Note that 'too' should become '2', not '2o'
*/

const textin = s => s.replace(/two|too|to/gi, '2');

console.log(textin('I love to text')) // 'I love 2 text'
console.log(textin('see you tomorrow')) // 'see you 2morrow'
console.log(textin('look at that octopus')) // 'look at that oc2pus'
