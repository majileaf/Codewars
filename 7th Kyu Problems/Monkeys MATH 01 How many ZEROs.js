/* Monkey's MATH 01: How many "ZERO"s?
Gigi is a clever monkey, living in the zoo, his teacher (animal keeper) recently taught him some knowledge of "0".

In Gigi's eyes, "0" is a character contains some circle (maybe one, maybe two).

So, a is a "0",b is a "0",6 is also a "0"，and 8 have two "0" ,etc...

Now, write some code to count how many "0"s in the text.

Let us see who is smarter? You ? or monkey?

Input always be a string (including words numbers and symbols)，You don't need to verify it, 
but pay attention to the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters.

Here is a table of characters：
Number of zeros 	Characters
1 	abdegopq069DOPQR     () <-- A pair of braces as a zero
2 	%&B8

Output will be a number of "0".
*/

const countzero = s => s.replace(/\(\)/g, '0').replace(/[%&B8]/g, '00').replace(/[^abdegopq069DOPQR]/g, '').length;

console.log(countzero("")) // 0
console.log(countzero("0")) // 1
console.log(countzero("1234567890")) // 5
console.log(countzero("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")) // 8
