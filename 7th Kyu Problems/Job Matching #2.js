/* Job Matching #2
Consider a matchmaking system that is designed to deliver jobs to software developers on a continual basis. 
As more quality jobs are handpicked into the system, they will be matched to all the enrolled developers; 
affording them better opportunities daily.

This means that somewhere in the system there exists functionality to take a job and match it against enrolled candidates. 
There are several factors that go into this matching, but we'll focus on two for the purposes of this Kata.

Create a function match which takes a job, and filters a list of candidates to the ones that match the job.
 We'll focus on two matching properties for this Kata: equity and location.
Equity

The candidate has an equity property (boolean) indicating if they desire equity, while the job will have a 
maximum equity property (float) representing the max amount of equity offered. If the maximum equity is zero, 
we can infer there is no equity offered. A job will match unless the candidate desires equity, but the job does not offer any.
Location

The candidate will have two location properties: current location and desired locations. 
A job can be located in multiple places as well which will be represented by its locations property. 
A match is when a job location is either in the candidate's current location or any of the candidate's desired locations.

So the candidate list might look like this:

let candidates = [{
  desiresEquity: true, 
  currentLocation: 'New York',
  desiredLocations: ['San Francisco', 'Los Angeles', 'Colorado']
}, ...];

And a job might look like this:

let job = { 
  equityMax: 1.2, 
  locations: ['New York', 'Kentucky'] 
}
*/

const match = (job, candidates) => candidates.filter(candidate => 
    !(!job.equityMax && candidate.desiresEquity) && 
     (job.locations.includes(candidate.currentLocation) || job.locations.filter(location => candidate.desiredLocations.includes(location)).length > 0));

let candidates = [{
  desiresEquity: true, 
  currentLocation: 'New York',
  desiredLocations: ['San Francisco', 'Los Angeles']
}, {
  desiresEquity: false, 
  currentLocation: 'San Francisco',
  desiredLocations: ['Kentucky', 'New Mexico'] 
}];

let job1 = { equityMax: 0, locations: ['Los Angeles', 'New York'] },
    job2 = { equityMax: 1.2, locations: ['New York', 'Kentucky'] };

console.log(match(job1, candidates)) // []
console.log(match(job2, candidates))
/*
[{
  desiresEquity: true, 
  currentLocation: 'New York',
  desiredLocations: ['San Francisco', 'Los Angeles']
}, {
  desiresEquity: false, 
  currentLocation: 'San Francisco',
  desiredLocations: ['Kentucky', 'New Mexico'] 
}]
