/* Password System
In Star Labs we use password system to unlock the lab doors and only Team Flash is given the password for these labs. 
The password system is made of a n x n keypad (n > 0).

One day Zoom saw Cisco using the password. He figured out that the password is symmetric about the centre point 
(the centre point for a n x n keypad will be the point with co-ordinates (n / 2, n / 2)). 
Now he has to try all possible symmetric combinations to unlock the door. Since he does not have enough time, 
he asks you to determine whether a given password is symmetric or not.

You will be given a flattened n x n binary grid containing elements as 0 if that key is not used and 1 if 
that key is used. You need to tell whether the given binary grid is symmetric according to the centre point. 
The grid might not be square; in that case you should return "No".

Your Task
Write a function that takes an one-dimensional array of integers containing 0 and 1 as input and returning 
"Yes" or "No" depending on whether the given password is symmetric or not.

Examples
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1] => "Yes"
The given password is symmetric about the centre point. For ease of understanding, the above 1D array can 
be represented as follows:  
1  1  0
0  0  0
0  1  1

[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] => "No" 
This array cannot be represented as a n x n matrix, so it's invalid.

[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] => "No" 
This password is not symmetric along the centre point.
