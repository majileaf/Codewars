/* Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
Converting a 12-hour time like "8:30 am" or "8:30 pm" to 24-hour time (like "0830" or "2030") sounds easy enough, right? 
Well, let's see if you can do it!

You will have to define a function, which will be given an hour (always in the range of 1 to 12, inclusive), 
a minute (always in the range of 0 to 59, inclusive), and a period (either a.m. or p.m.) as input.

Your task is to return a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.

Notes
    By convention, noon is 12:00 pm, and midnight is 12:00 am.
    On 12-hours clock, there is no 0 hour, and time just after midnight is denoted as, for example, 12:15 am. 
    On 24-hour clock, this translates to 0015.

const to24hourtime = (hour, minute, period) => [hour % 12 + (period === 'pm' ? 12 : 0), minute]

    .padStart(2, '0'))
    .join('');

console.log(to24hourtime( 1,  0, "am")) // "0100"
console.log(to24hourtime( 1,  0, "pm")) // "1300"
console.log(to24hourtime(12,  0, "am")) // "0000"
console.log(to24hourtime(12,  0, "pm")) // "1200"
console.log(to24hourtime( 6, 30, "am")) // "0630"
console.log(to24hourtime( 9, 45, "pm")) // "2145"
