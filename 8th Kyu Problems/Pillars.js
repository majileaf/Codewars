/*
There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars 
is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. 

Your function accepts three arguments:

number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).

Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar 
in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

const pillars = (num_pill, dist, width) => num_pill !== 1 ? (num_pill - 1) * dist * 100 + (num_pill * width) - 2 * width : 0;

console.log(pillars(1, 10, 10)) // 0
console.log(pillars(2, 20, 25)) // 2000
console.log(pillars(11, 15, 30)) // 15270
