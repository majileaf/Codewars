/* Rectangle into Squares
The drawing below gives an idea of how to cut a given "true" rectangle into squares 
("true" rectangle meaning that the two dimensions are different).
1 1 2² = 4 3² = 9

Can you translate this drawing into an algorithm?

You will be given two dimensions

    a positive integer length
    a positive integer width

You will return a collection or a string (depending on the language; Shell bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran return 
a string) with the size of each of the squares.

Examples in general form:
(depending on the language)

  sqInRect(5, 3) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
  sqInRect(3, 5) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
  
  You can see examples for your language in **"SAMPLE TESTS".**

Notes:
    lng == wdth as a starting case would be an entirely different problem and the drawing is planned to be interpreted 
    with lng != wdth. (See kata, Square into Squares. Protect trees! http://www.codewars.com/kata/54eb33e5bc1a25440d000891 
    for this problem).
    When the initial parameters are so that lng == wdth, the solution [lng] would be the most obvious but not in the spirit of 
    this kata so, in that case, return None/nil/null/Nothing or return {} with C++, [] with Perl, Raku.
    In that case the returned structure of C will have its sz component equal to 0.
    Return the string "nil" with Bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran.

const sqInRect = (lng, wdth) => {
    if (lng === wdth) return null;
    const arr = [];
    let [min, max] = [Math.min(lng, wdth), Math.max(lng, wdth)];

    while (min > 0) {
        arr.push(min);
        max = max - min;
        [max, min] = [Math.max(max, min), min = Math.min(max, min)];
    }
    return arr;

console.log(sqInRect(5, 5)) // null
console.log(sqInRect(5, 3)) // [3, 2, 1, 1]
console.log(sqInRect(3, 5)) // [3, 2, 1, 1]
console.log(sqInRect(20, 14)) // [14, 6, 6, 2, 2, 2]
